# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Louise wants to know how different campaigns finished in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The charted data for analysis:

The following graph is the parent category "theater" broken down to the outcomes for each month:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The following graph is the percentage of specified outcomes across different ranges of goal totals:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges and difficulties that were encountered were primarily using the correct capitalization of the values used to label the columns. Originally I mistyped them to be capitalized when the original values on the main sheet I was trying to use did not have them capitalized at all. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
